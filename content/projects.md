# My Projects

Here are some of the bioinformatics tools and projects I've developed:

## Cramino
A fast QC tool for long-read sequencing data, written in Rust. Extracts features from CRAM and BAM files for quality assessment.

## Kyber
A minimalistic quality assessment plot for long reads, showing a heatmap of read length vs accuracy.

## Phasius
Visualization tool for phase blocks in long-read sequencing data.

## Methplotlib
Tool for visualization and analysis of modified nucleotides from nanopore sequencing.

## NanoStat
Quality assessment tool for Oxford Nanopore sequencing data.

*More projects can be found on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/wdecoster).*
