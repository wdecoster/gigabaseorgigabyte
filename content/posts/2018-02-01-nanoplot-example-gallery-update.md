Months ago I wrote a blog post with an [example gallery of plots](https://gigabaseorgigabyte.wordpress.com/2017/06/01/example-gallery-of-nanoplot/) from [NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) so it might be time for an update with NanoPlot v1.9.2 (currently published as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/02/237180) together with [my other long read plotting and processing scripts](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanopack)).

The data below is from the [publicly available NA12878 dataset](https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878), release5, base called by the Oxford Nanopore GPU basecaller guppy and was recently [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060) (after being available on GitHub and as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/20/128835) for many months).  This dataset has some impressive ultra-long reads close to 1Mb, so log transformation and a maximum read length of 40kb was used for some plots in order to keep those esthetical and informative.
